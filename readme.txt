This project is going to be a PI
(the project made to finish the
course) for IFSC - Gaspar
https://www.ifsc.edu.br/web/campus-gaspar.

This code is all based on Olc3DConsoleEngine
made by https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA.
I mean, all I did was pass the C++ code
into Lua code, using the love2d framework 
to perform graphics in the screen.

I pretend to:
    - Create a more portable version of the framework
    - Maybe change its base graphical interface to 
      WxWidgets
    - Maybe create a way to the user input information
      about the vertices
